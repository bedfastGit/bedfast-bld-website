                        <p>
                            Due to my young age and thanks to my dad conviniently having a home office, I've always been in contact with computers, though I didn't really show interest for them until not so long ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've always been the game console type, being my first the PS2 at the age of 7. It wasn't until a cousing pointed out at me that PC was the way to go for gaming. That made me wonder what was it that would make him say such thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, in 2017, after months of research and savings, I pulled the trigger on my first rig which I built on my own for the first time in my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was just the begining of course.

                        <p style="color: whitesmoke">
                            I graduated in 2021 at ESTEC as a Higher Technician in 3D Animation, Video Games & Interactive Environments.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke">
                            As part of my education I joined the coding team at Isostopy sl developing the role of junior programmer. I consider this a fruitful experiece at both personal and proffesional levels.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke">
                            Along the way I've gathered a wide set of skills in the software side of things such as app/video game development, programming in various languages, web design, html, CSS... Additionally, I've learnt about the use of important tools like Unity3D or the adobe suite for video and photo editing.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: whitesmoke">
                            This grants the perspective regarding all these proffesional usecases, workflows and the necessities attached to them.

                        <p>
                            I guess my main hobby, and the reason that I am here for that matter, is gaming.
                        </p>
                        <p>More specifically, the souls saga by FormSoftware. Those games changed my life and became the reason why I decided to study video game development. If I had to highlight one in particular it would be Dark Souls, no doubt.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>When it comes to the music... my taste fluctuates a little, I'll put it that way. Currently I listen mainly to some subgeneres of metal such as alternative metal, metalcore or deathcore, but I just keep going deeper so we'll see how it ends.</p>
                        <p>Some of my favourite artists are Bring me the Horizon, Motionless in White, Spiritbox, Imminence and Brand of  Sacrifice.</p>
